### Introduction:
This is an example of the structural design pattern called "Composite" for an app that helps you learn about design patterns, you can find that app [here](https://github.com/JoseMartinez117/AppPatrones "here").

#### About: 
The example simulates that in a map of a 2D videogame can be simples obstacles ([Rocks](https://github.com/BloodSlayer-404/Composite/blob/master/src/main/java/org/example/Rock.java "Rocks"), [Trees](https://github.com/BloodSlayer-404/Composite/blob/master/src/main/java/org/example/Tree.java "Trees") and [Enemies](https://github.com/BloodSlayer-404/Composite/blob/master/src/main/java/org/example/Enemy.java "Enemies")) and [groups of obstacles](https://github.com/BloodSlayer-404/Composite/blob/master/src/main/java/org/example/CompoundObstacle.java "groups of obstacles"). 

You as a player, can interact with the simple obstacles and the groups of obstacles, see the coordinates or hitting them, this actions will be different depending on the obstacle type.

#### Documentation: 
The documentation of the methods and classes created for the example is in the [Javadoc](https://github.com/BloodSlayer-404/Composite/tree/master/JavaDoc "Javadoc") folder. 

You can check the coverage of the unitary test created for this proyect in the [htmlReport](https://github.com/BloodSlayer-404/Composite/tree/master/htmlReport "htmlReport") folder, you can create more test for your own methods.
